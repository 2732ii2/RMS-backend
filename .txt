: Learning Points into this
- As such i was stuck with integrating s3 bucket into backend
- and we are just good with the function 
- but the things were automatically gone into a pending state
- cause we have maded a async PutObjFunc
- and try to use that in req controller of api 
- with :  await PutObjFunc
- which actually taking that into a pending state
-  



: Which actually getting a lot of problem in get object signed url
- but after some command's we are able to solve it 
- `aws configure` try to add those which was mentioned in your env file 
- and you good to go



: mistakes that we did was stupidious ones

: we used client in place where we have to use s3 first mistake 
: second that we have to give content-type all ways so that it wouldn't just download
: but just open in that chrome


: some most important commands for bash or terminals : three commands save your life of here
1 . aws s3 presign s3://recipebucket123/chiken_biryani.jpeg  --region us-east-1 --expires-in 3600
2. aws configure
3. aws configure list
